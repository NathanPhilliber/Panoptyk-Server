Progress Report 8/6/18
Nathan Philliber

This week I was able to make more progress in getting the event system setup.
All events (excluding trade related ones) now have implemented client -> server messages
and server -> client messages.

This work also involved filling out the Agent, Room, and Item models. Models are able to
generate their own events and send updates in an intelligent way.


Plans for next week:
    Begin simplistic frontend.

Plans for future weeks:
    Implement trade events / logic.
    Login authentification system.
    System for saving / loading objects.
